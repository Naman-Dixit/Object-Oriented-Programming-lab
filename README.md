# ‚òï Object Oriented Programming Lab (Java)

This repository contains Java-based implementations of core **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts. The lab was conducted as part of the **Object Oriented Programming Lab** in **Year 2, Semester 4** of the B.Tech curriculum.

The lab includes **10 experiments**, each focusing on a specific principle or application of object-oriented programming using Java.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply **OOP principles** such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Develop Java programs using **classes, objects, constructors, and method overloading**.
- Implement **runtime polymorphism**, **abstract classes**, and **interfaces**.
- Handle **exceptions** effectively and perform **file operations** using Java I/O.
- Use **generics (templates)** for reusable code design.

## üìö List of Experiments

1. **Class and Object**  
   Create a simple class and demonstrate object creation, instance variables, and methods.

2. **Constructors and Method Overloading**  
   Implement default, parameterized constructors, and demonstrate method overloading.

3. **Encapsulation and Access Modifiers**  
   Use private variables and public getter/setter methods to implement encapsulation.

4. **Inheritance**  
   Demonstrate single and multilevel inheritance in Java.

5. **Polymorphism (Compile-time and Runtime)**  
   Use method overloading and method overriding with dynamic method dispatch.

6. **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**  
   Create an abstract class and implement multiple interfaces.

7. **Exception Handling**  
   Handle built-in and user-defined exceptions using try-catch-finally and throw/throws.

8. **File Handling**  
   Read from and write to files using Java's File I/O classes (`FileReader`, `BufferedReader`, `FileWriter`, etc.).

9. **Packages and Access Control**  
   Create user-defined packages and use access specifiers to control access.

10. **Generics and Collections**  
   Implement generic methods and use `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, and other collection classes.
